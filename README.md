# Reinforcement_Learning
In this project, I have implemented value iteration and Q-learning. The agents are being testnig on Gridworld

# Files + their description:
- valueIterationAgents.py -> A value iteration agent for solving known MDPs. 
- qlearningAgents.py -> Q-learning agents for Gridworld, Crawler and Pacman.

- mdp.py -> Defines methods on general MDPs. 
- learningAgents.py -> Defines the base classes ValueEstimationAgent and QLearningAgent , which agents will extend. 
- util.py -> Utilities, including util.Counter ,useful for Q- learners. 
- gridworld.py -> The Gridworld implementation. 

- environment.py -> Abstract class for general reinforcement learning environments. Used by gridworld.py . 
- graphicsGridworldDisplay.py -> Gridworld graphical display. 
- graphicsUtils.py -> Graphics utilities. 
- textGridworldDisplay.py -> Plug-in for the Gridworld text interface. 

Please note that this project was completed for CMPT 310: Introduction to AI, taught by Professor Ahmadreza Nezami. 


Class description: A survey of modern approaches for artificial intelligence (AI). Provides an introduction to a variety of AI topics and prepares students for upper-level courses. Topics include: problem solving with search; adversarial game playing; probability and Bayesian networks; machine learning; and applications such as robotics, visual computing and natural language.
